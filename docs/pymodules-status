This is a list of standard python modules that I didn't check for compatibility
with oranj with a reason. The reason should be given for each.

abc         - Oranj somewhat obviates this with tags
aifc        - I don't know what AIFF and AIFC files are. Don't have any, either
ast         - It is probably less than useful to have an ast parser for
              Python but not one for oranj. TODO: write ast module for
              oranj. Relegate ast to pyast.
binhex      - Module notes that it doesn't always work. I don't own a Macintosh.
asynchat    - Blocked by Github:#8 - ability to subclass Python classes.

These are the modules I specifically did check and the checks conducted:

array       - Checked the uses from Guido's optimization anecdote
              which should cover the basics. Flawless.
atexit      - Registered a function. Testing unregister didn't work
              because unregister does not exit in py2.6
base64      - Example provided with module works.
bisect      - I'm not entirely sure what this module does, but the example
              on its doc page does work.
bz2         - Compress and decompress works. This should test the basic
              functionality.
math        - Works perfectly. Should be rewritten and split up, per my plan
              To have better math support in oranj.
