Oranj directives are special commands to the interpreter. There are no
fundamental differences between directives and other statements, except
that directives usually either should not be present in a program or
significantly change the function of the interpreter.

All directives take the form

#!xxxxxxx

Where the directive name takes the place of xxxxxxx. The following directives
are implemented:

* clear
  Clears the screen. Particularly useful in the interactive console. PLEASE
  do not use as a method of clearing the screen within your program.

* drop
  Drop down to an oranj shell. This is useful to debug your scripts:

  if bad_thing {
      term << "Dropping down to shell. Why is bad_thing true?"
      #!drop
  }

* pydrop
  Drop down to a python shell. This is useful for deep debugging or, even more
  likely, debugging the interpreter itself.

* exit
  Exits the oranj program or shell.
