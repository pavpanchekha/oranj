* Interpreter
** ++/-- Need thought
    a[0]++ should work
** Cache links
   To implement extern with del:
   extern a
   del a
   Should delete the external version.
** Implement return/throw/yield
   Probably as exceptions
** Implement import
   This'll be tricky
** Str primitives
*** Extra escapes
    Documented in code
*** Escapes only if not r""
    Duh
* Parser
** Setattr/setindex
   C&P some code and I'll be good
* Lexer
** Fix 0b101001001
   It renders as base 10
