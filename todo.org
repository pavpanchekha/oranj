** Cache links
   To implement extern with del:
   extern a
   del a
   Should delete the external version.
** Implement return/throw/yield
   Probably as exceptions
** Implement import
   This'll be tricky
** Str primitives
*** Extra escapes
    Documented in code
*** Escapes only if not r""
    Duh
** Function calls are horribly wrong
** Find out why some additions break
** Setattr/setindex
