* Interpreter
** Do operators right
   PLEASE
*** ++/-- Need thought
    a[0]++ should work
** Indexing
   Requires either a special case or its own function to deal with
   a[1,2,3] -> [a[1], a[2], a[3]]
** Cache links
   To implement extern with del:
   extern a
   del a
   Should delete the external version.
** Implement break/continue/return/throw/yield
   Because I should
** Implement import
   This'll be tricky
** Str primitives
*** Extra escapes
    Documented in code
*** Escapes only if not r""
    Duh
* Parser
** Setattr/setindex
   C&P some code and I'll be good
* Lexer
** Fix 0b101001001
   It renders as base 10
