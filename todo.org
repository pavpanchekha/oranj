* Interpreter
** Cache links
   To implement extern with del:
   extern a
   del a
   Should delete the external version.
** Implement throw/yield
   Probably as exceptions
** Implement import
   This'll be tricky
** Make instance methods work
   Damned self!
** Make passing keyword arguments to user-defined functions work
* Library
** globals / locals
** help
** vars
** enumerate is broken
** filter does nothing
