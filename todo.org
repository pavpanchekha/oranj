* Parser
** a ! b
   Behavior:
   a ! b -> b(a)
   a ! b(...) -> b(a, ...)
   a ! b() -> b(a)
** Fix multi-assign get(attr|index)
   It works, but I can't make them anything but the
   last argument
** Fix multi-assign w/ more than 3 idents
   Dum Dum Dum...
* Interpreter
** Cache links
   To implement extern with del:
   extern a
   del a
   Should delete the external version.
** Implement throw/yield
   Probably as exceptions
** Implement import
   This'll be tricky
** keyword arguments are broken
** 'is' is broken
** allow OrObjects to be added etc
** OrObjecting lists and tuples doesn't OrObjectify their elements
* Library
** about: version, copyright, credits, license
** globals / locals
** help
** vars
** OO'd tuples don't work
** why does io(6) not raise an error? What does it do?
** coerce fails
** enumerate is broken
** filter does nothing
