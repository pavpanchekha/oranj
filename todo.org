* Interpreter
** Cache links
   To implement extern with del:
   extern a
   del a
   Should delete the external version.
** Implement throw/yield
   Probably as exceptions
** Implement import
   This'll be tricky
** Function calls are horribly wrong
** Setattr/setindex

* Library
** Lexical scoping
** Make inf singleton
