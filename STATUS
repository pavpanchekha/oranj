Currently, mu-oranj (MicroOranj) works, in that oranj understands all
arithmetic, conditional, and looping constructs. Soon, exceptions will be
implemented. Functions are now implemented and as soon as I get classes done,
I'll begin to focus on the bugs that annoy us all.

Work is also progressing on the test suite, located in the tests subdirectory.
These are run with the tests tool that I am developing in parallel.

Lastly, an effort to document Oranj will begin as soon as mu-oranj is complete.
