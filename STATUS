Currently, mu-oranj (MicroOranj) works, in that oranj understands all
arithmetic, conditional, and looping constructs. Soon, exceptions will be
implemented, and then I can move on to addings functions and classes.

Work is also progressing on the test suite, located in the tests subdirectory.
These are run with the tests tool that I am developing in parallel.

Lastly, an effort to document Oranj will begin as soon as mu-oranj is complete.
