The core of Oranj should work completely, together with small fixes for
libraries such as numpy. You should be able to use any python modules (if you
cannot, report it at http://github.com/pavpanchekha/oranj/issues).

Work is progressing on various oranj-specific modules, such as integrating in
the files.py library.

Work is also progressing on the test suite, located in the tests subdirectory.
These are run with the tests tool that I am developing in parallel.

Lastly, an effort to document Oranj will begin as soon as mu-oranj is complete.
