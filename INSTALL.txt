
There are several ways to install oranj. The following
lists methods of installing from source. Non-source-based
installations are described on the main page for oranj,
http://pavpanchekha.github.com/oranj/

Method 1: Distutils
===================

Installation involves only running

  sudo python setup.py install

Replace sudo with your favorite way of becoming root.
Oranj should have no dependancies except python 2.6.

Method 2: Debian Package
========================

This method is prefered if you are on a Debian-based
(read: Ubuntu and friends included) system.

First, run

  sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev fakeroot cdbs debhelper

This will install necessary programs.
Then run the following to generate your debian package:

  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc

Finally, to install the package just created, you can
run:

  sudo dpkg -i ../oranj*.deb
